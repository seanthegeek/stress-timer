{"body":"A HTML5-based timer that designed to act as a social stresser during an exam. \r\nA black circle represents the time allotted to complete the exam. The sound of a \r\nticking clock is used to emphasize the passage of time. As time elapses, the \r\ncircle becomes a smaller arc (representing the remaining time), and the \r\nticking volume is gradually increased.\r\n\r\nFor best results use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAll dependencies are included, under the terms of their respective licenses.\r\n\r\n- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)\r\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n- [flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) (with the pie plugin)\r\n- [ExplorerCanvas](http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/) (optional, for IE <= 8 support)\r\n- [PreloadJS](http://www.createjs.com/#!/PreloadJS)\r\n- [SoundJS](http://www.createjs.com/#!/SoundJS) (with Flash plugin for browsers that lack HTML5 audio support)\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Concept by Teresa Lonkard\r\n- Development by Sean Whalen\r\n- Sound by [jackstrebor](http://www.freesound.org/people/jackstrebor/sounds/34855/); used under a [Sampling+](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/) license","google":"","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
