stress-timer
============

A HTML5-based timer that is designed to act as a social stresser during an exam. 
A black circle represents the time allotted to complete the exam. The sound of a 
ticking clock is used to emphasize the passage of time. As time elapses, the 
circle becomes an increasingly smaller arc (representing the remaining time), and the 
ticking volume is gradually increased.

A demo can be found [here][1]. For best results use [Google Chrome][2].
