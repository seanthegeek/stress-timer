stress-timer
============

A HTML5-based timer that designed to act as a social stresser during an exam. 
A black circle represents the time allotted to complete the exam. The sound of a 
ticking clock is used to emphasize the passage of time. As time elapses, the 
circle becomes a smaller arc (representing the remaining time), and the 
ticking volume is gradually increased.

For best results use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).
