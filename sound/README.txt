These files are based on the "Clock Ticking" recording by jackstrebor; used under a Sampling+ license. 

"This is a battery operated wall clock with second hand making the tick noise. 
Recorded digitally with a Canon Digital Video Camcorder GL2 using a 
DAK Super-directional Shotgun Microphone, Model UEM-83R"

The recording was slightly trimmed to make looping less obvious. 
The recording was then transcoded from AIF to MP3 and OGG for browser support.
